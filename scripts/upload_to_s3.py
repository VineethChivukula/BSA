    Uploads all CSV files in the 'gen_data' directory to Amazon S3.

    This function creates the 'gen_data' directory if it doesn't exist and walks through all the files in the directory.
    It uploads each file with a '.csv' extension to Amazon S3 using the S3Client.upload_file() method.
    If the upload is successful, it prints the file name and the S3 URL. If there is an error during the upload,
